How to use this:

---------------------
Installing the kernel
---------------------

Checkout an ubuntu 22.04 machine on cloudlab (wasn't able to get it working on centos), and clone
this repo there. Then, run the following steps,

cd linux-6.12.3/
./setup.sh (just choose default options, and exit menuconfig dialog box with no changes).
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make modules_install
sudo make install
sudo reboot

-------------
Known issues
-------------

- The ubuntu kernel seems to hang (has soft CPU core stalls, upon rebooting. I think this is an issue
with installing a newer version kernel, although might be something to do with my changes too?

- Using the fstore scratch_offs currently has issues (still faults in the kernel, etc) for now just
using hash maps (done by setting scratch_offs=-1, scratch_sz=0 as supplied to the fstore_register_map.
